## Infra and tools

- [Tusky Token-Gated Access](https://github.com/tusky-io/tusky-smart-contracts/blob/main/TGA.md) - [Tusky’s](https://tusky.io/) token-gated access (TGA) capability lets you restrict vault content exclusively to users holding specific tokens. Built with Seal, it enables secure, composable token-based access to encrypted files in private vaults.
- [Decryptable Move Enum](https://github.com/studio-mirai/decryptable) - A Sui Move package implements a `Decryptable` enum which stores a decryptable piece of data. Recommends Seal for encryption.
- [Dominion Lancer](https://lancer.dominion.zone/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/dominion-zone/dominion-lancer): A secure and confidential platform for responsible vulnerability disclosure on the Sui blockchain. Submit exploits via trusted enclaves, generate verifiable evidence, and enable safe, onchain researcher rewards.

## B2B and B2C projects

- [Epoch One](https://epoch-one.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/T-adero1/epoch_one): EpochOne E-Sign is a contract management platform that merges traditional e-signatures with blockchain security. Users can create, manage, and sign contracts with cryptographic protection and decentralized storage.
- [Zeroleaks](https://www.zeroleaks.xyz/) - [Docs](https://zeroleaks.notaku.site/): ZeroLeaks is a secure, anonymous, and verifiable whistleblowing platform built on the Sui blockchain. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect whistleblowers while proving the authenticity of leaked documents.
- [Sui Shadow](https://sui-shadow.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/Sahilgill24/SuiShadow): Sui Shadow is a privacy-first art platform on Sui where artists encrypt hidden artworks into NFTs using Seal-powered access control. Encrypted chunks are stored off-chain in Walrus, and collectors unlock them post-purchase for a secure, suspenseful reveal.
- [Passman](https://passman-six.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/dam2onkid/passman): Passman is a decentralized password manager built on Sui, secured with Seal encryption technology. It gives users full control over their passwords without relying on any central authority.
- [Mandy](https://mandylab.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/rzexin/Mandy): Mandy is a Sui-based dApp for sending encrypted `time capsule` letters unlockable at a future date. Seal handles encryption and timed decryption, while attachments are securely stored in Walrus.
- [SuiShare](https://sui-share.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/xiaodi007/suiShare): SuiShare is a decentralized content publishing platform on Sui for encrypted media like images, videos, and markdown. It gives creators full ownership, access control, and monetization tools in a censorship-resistant environment.
- [DemoDock](https://demo-dock.vercel.app/) - [Github repo](https://github.com/404ll/DemoDock/blob/main/README_EN.md): DemoDock is a decentralized platform for Web3 developers to securely store, manage, and showcase demo projects. It uses Seal for encryption, Walrus for storage, and gives creators and admins a private, organized space for collaboration and review.
