# Contributing

The goal of this repository is to showcase appealing, well-documented, and useful projects in the Seal ecosystem.

## Submission guidelines

### Submitting new tools

- Please ensure your tool has complete and accessible documentation at its primary location. We aim to direct users to high-quality, maintained resources.
- Add your tool’s entry to the `README.md` using the same format as existing listings (name, description, and link).
- Submit a pull request with your additions against the `main` branch.

### Editing existing tools

- For updates to existing listings (e.g., new features, repo links, description tweaks), simply open a pull request against the main branch.

## Removing projects

We generally do not remove listed projects unless:

- They are broken or non-functional
- They’ve been deprecated by their maintainers
- They have been clearly superseded by a more actively maintained or better-supported alternative
